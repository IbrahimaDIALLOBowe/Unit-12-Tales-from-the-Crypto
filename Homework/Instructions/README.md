#### Natural Language Processing

In this section, you will use NLTK and Python to tokenize the text for each coin. Be sure to:

1. Lowercase each word
2. Remove punctuation
3. Remove stop words

Next, look at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin.

1. Use NLTK to produce the ngrams for N = 2.
2. List the top 10 words for each coin.

Finally, generate word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin.
